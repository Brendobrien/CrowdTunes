# crowd-tunes
Summer 2015

This project was created while working for CrowdTunes, a start-up in Durham, NC which is apart of the American Underground.

I utilize jQuery, Bootstrap, and Chart.js to create a data dashboard that visually represents noteworthy statistics.

Specifically, most of the coding occurs within **reportsView.js** so check that one out
